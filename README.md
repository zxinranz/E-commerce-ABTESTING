# Data Insights for UI Change Evaluation

For this project, you will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website.<br>  Your goal is to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

## A/B Testing
A/B testing, also called split testing, is a method of determining which of two versions of a product feature, web page, campaign element, or other asset performs better for a certain goal. You can use A/B testing to improve the product development workflow, user interface (UI), or conversion rates. Essentially, A/B testing eliminates all the guesswork out of website optimization and enables experience optimizers to make data-backed decisions. In A/B testing, A refers to ‘control’ or the original testing variable. Whereas B refers to ‘variation’ or a new version of the original testing variable.

## Steps
1. Calculate the corresponding goal metrics for both groups  
2. Use bootstrap to calculate the confidence interval 
3. Apply graphs to interpret the results 
4. Make the recommendation 
5. Use logistic regression to decide whether we should launch the change
